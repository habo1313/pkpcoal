### PART OF THE GRADIENT BASED OPTIMIZATION ####

# initial guess vector of Gradient based optimization is the ...Init vector defined for the Evolutionary algorithm

selectedGradBasedOpt = 'fmin' # see  http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html#module-scipy.optimize
# possible inputs: 'fmin' or 'leastsq' (recommended) ; 'fmin_cg','fmin_bfgs','fmin_ncg','fmin_slsqp'
Tolerance = 1e0   # relative error to abort
MaxIter   = 1e3     # integer

### USED FOR BOTH ####

ScaleFactor = 1e4   # large values, gives better fittings
